CheckPlayer can be instantiated with a version, autoUpdate, and no callbacks, to create the simplest approach
to verifying minimum plugin version and updating if need be.

If you visit this page from a browser that has no Flash Player plugin installed, and click the button, it will 
say the version check failed. If you visit it with a plugin version less than 6.0.65, it will also say the version
check failed. If you visit the page from a browser with at least version 6.0.65, but less than 9.0.115 (what the 
demo checks for), you will be prompted to update the plugin. If you visit the page with at least version 9.0.115, 
and click the button, it will say the version check passed.
