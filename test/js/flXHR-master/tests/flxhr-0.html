Ok, first, this is Demo #0 because I had to add it later, and didn't want to re-number all the other demos. This 
demo shows the same thing as Demo #1, except it illustrates the (perhaps simpler to understand) syntax of setting 
properties on the instantiated object rather than sending the configuration as parameters to the constructor of the 
instance.
