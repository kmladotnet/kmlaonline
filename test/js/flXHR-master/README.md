flXHR & flensed

flXHR (and its parent project "flensed") is an open-source project using flash+javascript to create a drop-in replacement of the XMLHTTPRequest object for cross-domain Ajax.

The site and all project data used to live on its own site at http://flensed.com, but has now been moved/dumped here on github to ensure that the project remains open and available for posterity.

Given recent advances such as CORS (Cross-origin Resource Sharing) which implement cross-domain Ajax using the native XHR interface, flXHR has now accomplished its goal and is no longer necessary. It would only be useful in older browsers as a shim.

Moreover, given that flash has become increasingly marginalized in the web development arena, in favor of standards-based and open web technology choices such as HTML5 and JavaScript, this project is no longer being maintained.
